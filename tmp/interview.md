We are excited to progress further in the process, scheduling the next 2 technical interviews: an "Algorithm Interview" and the "Search Architecture" interview. My colleague Lisette will be reaching out to schedule them.

01:00 PM - 01:45 PM (PDT) - Search Architecture Interview -Salim Fakhouri (Machine Learning Engineer)
01:45 PM - 02:30 PM (PDT) - Algorithm Interview- Victoria Huang (Software Engineer)
To answer your question, the algorithm interview does not cover coding skills, just knowledge evaluation with some case examples. We'd like to learn your basic knowledge based on your background. 


Algorithm Interview (45 minutes) - we’ll cover questions about query understanding and the retrieval side of the search
Search Architecture Interview (45 minutes) - we’ll cover data flows and search request flow architecture from the user to the back end. Using a collaborative whiteboarding tool


I just returned after 2 weeks of time off, and I can see you had a chance to meet with some of my colleagues, I hope you have enjoyed the conversations completed so far! Great news to share - We'd be looking to progress to a 30-minute follow-up interview with Jimmy Li, he's looking to dive a bit deeper into the "query" side of things. My colleague Lisette will be reaching out to schedule the chat.
